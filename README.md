# Instrumentation Ampifier using INA128

This project designs an INA128-based instrumentation amplifier to amplify small differential signals with low noise and high input impedance, suited for medical and sensor uses. Gain is optimized with precision resistors, with testing confirming accuracy and reliability.

## A Glance at the Instrumentation Ampifier

Instrumentation amplifiers are high-precision differential amplifiers widely used to amplify small differential signals, especially in medical devices, sensor data acquisition, and industrial measurement systems. The INA128 is a preferred choice in these applications due to its low noise, high input impedance, and strong common-mode rejection. This report presents the design and implementation of an instrumentation amplifier using the INA128, detailing its operating principles, key benefits, and potential enhancements for improved performance across diverse applications.
